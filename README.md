**Siam Quantum** is a compact open-source quantum simulation program, designed for research and education in mind. For research, its speed and accuracy are comparable to the well-establised quantum chemistry programs such as GAMESS. You could use it to do research and publish your results with confident that your resutls can be reproduced. For education, it is extensively documented in an easy-to-read math display style using Jupyter Notebook which can also be viewed directly on GitHub.
